Hi Helium!  The vast majority of my code for projects is confidential (belongs to prior companies) or is through the Georgia Tech OMSCS program, 
which does not allow uploads of solutions to GitHub.

I noticed that a GitHub is required and created this one.  I would be more than happy to speak with you about my past projects.

Most notable to you would be:
  - Creating test applications and rigs for IOT devices (performed this at Soneter/WiFlo for flow rate sensors)
  - Using data analytics to structure sales incentives/compensation/rewards for a team of over 230 reps, such that the system is difficult to cheat and rewards performance 
  - Heavy work in ETL and with data pipelines, all the way from the ingestion point to visualization (datasets often containing millions of rows)
  - Machine learning project with OMSCS to predict the likelihood that specific restaurants exist in a zip code, which is comparable to a helium miner occupying a hex
  - Using census data to predict sales and set quotas
  - Experience with creating and interacting with core fanbase groups to drive change (Best Selling Kindle Novel in Sci Fi from engaging online to drive growth)  
  
The network you are developing is incredible and I would love to be a part of it.  Thank you for your consideration and I am excited to potentially become a contributing member.

Sincerely,

Henry  Marcacci
